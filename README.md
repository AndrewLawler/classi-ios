    <h4> Intro </h4>
    <p>
    I was the sole iOS Developer/Designer on an app project called classi. What is Classi? Classi is the new way to search for classic car buyers and sellers in your area. Use the app to make an account, list your vehicles or just see what's already out there. For classi i produced the first designs in Adobe XD and then ported those to Zeplin and implemented them using Swift.

    <h4> Project Tech Stack </h4>
    <p>
    Classi has both an app and also a website created using React. The entire project used the MERN stack which means the backend is a MongoDB database. The project gave me more experience working with external databases in iOS apps.
